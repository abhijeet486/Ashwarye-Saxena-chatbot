I'm happy to help you with your query! However, it seems like there is no query provided. Please provide the query you'd like me to answer, and I'll do my best to assist you while following the instructions carefully. Remember, I can only respond by drawing from the knowledge provided in the context, external information, and general knowledge pertinent to MSPSDC.

Once you provide the query, I'll extract the relevant paragraphs of content that are relevant to answering the question (if such text exists).

from llama3 chain with tokens : 
The document appears to be related to the Excise, Registration, Taxation & Stamps Department of Meghalaya, India. It provides information on e-Registration for dealer registration for IMFL (Indian Made Foreign Liquor) products.

To answer your question "ext", I'm assuming you meant to ask about the external documents required for the application process. Based on the provided context, the following external documents are required:

1. Duly filled Application Form (Editable)
2. EPIC (Voter ID)
3. Professional Tax Clearance Certificate
4. Photo (Passport size)
5. Bank Pass Book
6. Deed of agreement (if not own place)
7. Proof of place of business including Tenancy/Lease agreement if not own place
8. Proof of ownership if own place (Electricity Bill/Telephone Bill)
9. Pan Card

from llama3 chain verification : 
The response I provided earlier is not correct.

Upon re-examining the context, I realize that the user query "ext" doesn't make sense in this context. There is no information related to "ext" in the provided context.

The correct answer for the user query "ext" would be "Unknown" or "Not Found" since there is no relevant information in the context.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier response.
