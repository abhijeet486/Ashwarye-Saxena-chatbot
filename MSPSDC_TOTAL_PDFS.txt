MEGHALAYA STATE PUBLIC SERVICES DELIVERY COMMISSION 
About The Commission 
The Meghalaya Right to Public Services Act, 2020 was enacted by the State to guarantee citizen’s right to time-bound delivery of notified citizen-related services from Government offices. The Commission was set up to oversee, monitor and regulate the implementation of this Act. It has the jurisdiction, powers and functions to ensure that notified public services to citizens of the State are provided and to impose penalty on delinquent public officers if they fail to deliver an entitled service within the stipulated time. 
Presently, 188 services of various Government Departments have been notified under this Act. Citizens who apply for any of these services have the right to receive these services in time and can approach the Commission as the second Appellate Authority in case the services have been denied or delayed wrongfully. 
Powers of the Meghalaya State Public Services Delivery Commission 
The State Public Services Delivery Commission shall have the same powers as are vested in a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in respect of the following matters, namely :- 
Summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath; 
Discovery and production of any document or other material object liable to be produced as evidence; 
Receiving evidence on affidavits; 
Requisitioning of any public record; 
Issuing summons for examination of witnesses; 
Reviewing its decisions, direction and orders; and 
Any other matter which may be prescribed. 
The State Public Services Delivery Commission shall not be bound by the procedure laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice and subject to the other provisions of this Act and of any Rules made thereunder. The State Public Services Delivery Commission shall have the powers to regulate its own procedure. 
All proceedings before the State Public Services Delivery Commission shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of Section 193 and Section 228 of the Indian Penal Code and the State Public Services Delivery Commission shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for the purposes of Section 345 and Section 346 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. 
No Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to settle, decide or deal with any question or to determine any matter which is by or under this Act required to be settled, decided or dealt with or to be determined by the State Public Services Delivery Commission.

 1 Introduction  
The Meghalaya State Public Services Delivery Commission  has been allotted land measuring 0.64 acres at 
the New Shillong Township in the same campus with the IT Park  for setting up its own campus .  
Scope of Work  
The Geotechnical investigation is required to be undertaken at the location  for selection and design of foun-
dation system of the various structure. The investigation is planned in such a way that the information ob-
tained from the subsurface exploration and subsequent laboratory test is to be incorporate d into geotechnical 
analysis. The objective of this investigation is to  ascertain the value and properties of soil available  on site at 
various  depths with a view to arrive at the safe bearing capacity of soil for foundation with their capacities.  
Other information such as mechanical and physical properties, parameters and characteristics like grain -size 
distribution, sensitivity, any existence of deleterious material in soil or groundwater, etc., are also to be de-
termined. The exploration should also throw light on groundwater level, artesian condition, if any, likely well -
sinking and pile driving effort, likely constructional difficulties, etc.  
Description:  
The Primary goal of this scope of service to obtain subsoil properties to ensure effective design and con-
struction of the office building for the Commission . 
Field Work Methodology & Specifications:  
The fieldwork shall consist of excavation, drilling of boreholes for the purpose of collection of undisturbed 
and disturbed samples, standard penetration tests (at 1.5 m interval), other field tests, as specified by the 
Engineer -In-Charge, and preparation of bore logs. It will also include preservation and testing of disturbed 
and undisturbed samples  and water samples  from boreholes, borrow pits, etc. as specified by the Engineer -
In-Charge. Undisturbed and disturbed soil samples are to be collected at 1m interval or wherever strata 
changes. All in -situ tests shall be supplemented by laboratory investigation  reports incorporating the obser-
vations made during the field investigation and the results of laboratory tests, analysis of all results, founda-
tion recommendations with calculations and other related information along with necessary charts, curves 
and drawings.  Relevant  latest Indian Standards such as IS:1498, IS:1892, IS:2131, IS:2132, IS:2720, and 
Appendix -2 of IRC:78 shall be followed for guidance.  
Depth of bore should cover all strata likely to cause undesirable settlement affecting stability. The depth of 
boreholes below the ground level should be to a maximum of 20 m for required structure locations . However, 
borings can be terminated at shallower depths when firm strata or bedrock is encountered (beyond N= 100). 
If highly compressible strata are encountered, the boring may have to be taken deeper.  
    
Terms of Reference for Geotechnical Investigation Survey

 Exploratory Boreholes:  
The location of boreholes is to be finalized in consultation and approval of the Engineer -In-Charge. For all 
borings, necessary information as detailed below shall be given.  
• Location with reference map , showing “N” direction, nearest landmark (as available) and show-
ing the Bore Hole location.  
• Pit/ borehole number and dimensions  
• Reduced level (RL) of ground surface or other reference point (the RL shall be with respect to 
GTS datum)  
• Dates of starting and completion  
• General description of strata met with and depths at which they are met  
• The level at which the sub -soil water is met  
• Visual description of strata and soil classification  showing all characteristics  “C” values, OMC 
etc. as may be required in the design.  
• Results of Field tests . 
• Laboratory results of tests on disturbed and undisturbed samples . 
• Any other information and remarks . 
• Recommendation for specific foundation . 
No. of  Boreholes & Depth:  
Below is a summary of the quantity of boreholes and borehole depths .  
▪ Tentative No. of Boreholes = 2  
▪ Tentative Depth of Boreholes (Mtr.) = 15  
The quantities and depth as mentioned below are indicative only and subject to change based on actual site 
condition and shall be updated accordingly. The amount payable will be decided based on actual work done.  
Sub-Soil Water:  
The subsoil water shall be tested for chemical properties to ascertain whether there is any hazard that may 
cause deterioration of concrete in foundations. Where dewatering is expected to be required, permeability 
characteristics shall also be determined.  
Laboratory Tests:  
Separate laboratory tests are required to be conducted for obtaining the properties of cohesionless and co-
hesive soils. These tests are enumerated below. These should be carried out, wherever practicable, accord-
ing to the soil type. While selecting the tests and interpreting the results, limitations of the applicability of the 
test should be considered.  
Tests to be conducted (as applicable):  
 Classification tests, index tests, bulk and dry density determination  
 Shear strengths by triaxial/direct shear  
 Unconfined Compression Test

Reports and Recommendations:  
Reports are to be submitted in triplicate in hard copy as well as in soft copy containing details and discus-
sions on the type of foundations and recommendations for the site. 
The Geotechnical investigation results should be useful to establish the soil parameters that are to be adopt-
ed for the finalization of the type of foundation of the structure as per relevant latest IS codes. The Geotech-
nical investigation report shall include detailed calculations with specific recommendations for the safe bear-
ing capacity of the soil at various depths for different sizes of foundations. If pile foundation is recommended, 
necessary calculations and details regarding the type, depth, diameter, capacity (vertical, horizontal, and 
uplift), etc. should be mentioned  (single  or group of piles).  
2 DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS  
This detailed technical  specification is intended for carrying out soil investigation.  
2.1 SCOPE  
This specification covers the technical requirements for a detailed Geotechnical investigation and submission 
of a detailed Geo -technical report.  The work shall include mobilization of all necessary equipment providing 
necessary engineering supervision and technical personnel, skilled and unskilled labour etc., as required to 
carry out the entire field as well as laboratory investigations, analysis and interpretation of data collected and

or as indicated elsewhere in this specification.  When the boreholes are to be terminated in soil stra-
ta, an additional standard penetration test shall be carried out at the termination depth.  However, the 
depth of termination shall be determined after consultation and certification from the Employer’s En-
gineer  on the field Borelog.   
c. Casing pipe shall be used in the boreholes to support its sides wherever necessary;  it shall be en-
sured that its bottom and is at all times less than 15 cm above the bottom of the borehole and not 
below the level at which the test has to be conducted or sampling has to be done.  In case of cohe-
sion-less soils the advancement of the casing pipe shall be such that it does not disturb the soil to be 
tested or sampled.  The casing shall be advanced by slowly turning the casing pipe and not by driv-
ing. 
d. In-situ tests shall be conducted,  and undisturbed samples shall be obtained at specified intervals in 
the boreholes.  Representative disturbed samples shall be preserved for conducting various tests in 
the laboratory.  Water table in the borehole shall be carefully recorded and reported.  No wa-
ter/drilling mud shall be added while boring above ground water table.  For cohesion -less soil below 
water table, the water level in the borehole shall be at all times be maintained sufficiently above the 
water table.  
e. The borehole shall be cleaned using suitable tools up to the depth of testing or sampling, ensuring 
that there is minimum disturbance of the soil at the bottom of the borehole.  The process of jetting 
through an open tube sampler shall not be permitted.

 f. In cohesive soils, the borehole may be cleaned using a bailer with flap valve.  Gentle circulation of 
drilling fluid shall be done when rotary mud circulation boring is adopted.  
g. On completion of the boreholes, the Contractor shall backfill all the bore holes with neat cement 
grout as directed by the Engineer.  
5.1.2  Rotary Mud Circulation Boring  
This method  could be used in all types of soil below water table.  In this method boring shall be done by ro-
tating the bit fixed at the bottom of the drill rod.   Proper care shall be taken to keep firm contact between the 
bit and the bottom of the borehole.  Bentonite , attapulgite, or biodegradable mud  or mud laden fluids shall be 
used as the drilling fluid to serve as the protective surface inside the borehole.  Use of percussion tool shall 
be permitted in hard clays and dense sandy deposits.  A stable boring shall be maintained at all times to pre-
vent the hole from caving in. No less than 20 kg. each of micatex (or equal) and barite (or equal) shall be 
kept at drilling location to immediately correct any hole stability problem. The fluid in the borings shall be 
maintained above the groundwater table at all times. Borings that will be used for installation of observation 
wells shall be drilled only with casing or with biodegradable mud.  
 
Observations shall be made of groundwater levels in all borings. All water conditions, including gain or loss 
of water or drilling mud, and the presence of gas or artesian pressure shall be recorded on the boring logs at 
the depths encountered.  
 
On completion of the boring, the hole shall be filled with a neat cement grout.  The approximate proportions 
of the grout shall consist of 200 litres of water, 80 kg. (2 bags) of cement, and 10 kg of bentonite. The drilling 
rods shall be placed at the bottom of the hole and the grout shall be pumped into the hole through the rods. 
The rods shall not be withdrawn from the bottom until the hole is filled. As the rod is withdrawn, grout shall be 
pumped to maintain the grout level at the top of the hole.  
 
5.1.3  Rock Boring  
Rotary type drilling machines shall be used for boring. The Contractor shall take rock core samples by 
means of a diamond drill, as described in ASTM D 2113 -83. Single/double tube core barrels fitted with dia-
mond drill bits shall be used for coring of NX size samples through rock formations. Details of rocks drilling 
data including RQI. along with the sampling details shall be listed in the respective bore logs.  
The term “rock” shall be applied to any materials that cannot be penetrated by the chopping bit. Soft or de-
composed rock shall be sampled with a driven sampler whenever possible. When drilling through rock or 
boulders, the chopping or roller bit shall be used to penetrate all disintegrated rock. The casing shall be firm-
ly seated on the rock by driving and washing out before inserting the core barrel in the hole. The rock shall 
be drilled until the required depth is reached.  When the core is broken off, it shall be withdrawn, labeled, and 
stored before the drilling is continued.    
Terms of Reference for Geotechnical Investigation Survey  
 Page 8 
 
  
The drilling into rock shall be done with a double or triple split -tube core barrel and side discharge diamond 
bit, which will produce a core from the rock penetrated. The core will be a minimum of 55 mm in diameter.  
 
The Contractor shall exercise due care to obtain satisfactory cores with at least 85 percent recovery in bed 
rock and boulders. In case it is impossible to obtain the required percentage of recovery, the Contractor shall 
maintain a maximum percentage by regulating the speed and rate of feed of the drill and the amount of drill 
water.  The required core barrel will be at least 1.5 m long.  If it proves to be impossible to obtain the neces-
sary recovery through no fault of the Contractor, after he has used special care, methods, and equipment, 
the Engineer may relax the percentage requirements to fit the field conditions.  
 
The rock cores shall be carefully placed in suitable wooden boxes that are partitioned so that the rock from 
each core run could be kept separately. Rock cores shall be suitably labelled  and arranged neatly in the 
boxes, in the sequence in which the materials were removed from the hole. The depths of the top and bot-
tom of the run and the amount of recovery shall be clearly marked. Rock cores from two borings shall not be 
placed in the same box.  Core boxes shall be fully equipped with all necessary partitions, covers, hinges, 
screws for holding down the cover, and suitable identification plates and tags.  All precautions will be taken 
to minimize disturbance of the rock core samples during transportation.  
 
Selected specimen(s) of rock core may be designated by the Site Engineer  for special packing and preserva-
tion. The selected specimen(s) shall be wrapped with aluminium foil and then placed inside a heavy -duty 
cardboard cylinder and sealed at both ends with a flexible microcrystalline wax.  
 
5.1.4  Supplementary Borings  
In the event of the executed borehole logs exhibiting varying subsurface conditions, the contractor shall 
forthwith submit in writing, the results of these boreholes to the Employer  before demobilization.  
The contractor may be required to bore additional boreholes as directed by the Employer’s Engineer . 
Drilled holes that are abandoned before reaching the specified depth because of mechanical failure of drilling 
equipment or other causes, shall be supplemented by another hole adjacent to the first, all at the contractor’s 
cost.  
Penetration to the depth where the hole was abandoned may be done by any method selected by the con-
tractor that will permit completion of the new hole below the elevation where the last satisfactory sample was 
obtained in the abandoned hole and penetration shall be made and samples taken in the supplementary hole 
in the same manner specified for the original hole.

 5.2 Standard Penetration Test  
This test shall be conducted in all types of soil deposits met within a bore hole to find the variation in the soil 
stratification by correlating with the number of blows required for unit penetration of a standard penetrometer.  
This test shall be conducted at 1.5m intervals and every change of strata starting from 1.0m below ground 
level and as per the direction of the Engineer.  The specifications for the equipment and other accessories, 
procedure for conducting the test and collection of disturbed soil samples shall conform to IS: 2131.  
The test shall be carried out by driving a standard split spoon sampler in the bore hole by means of a 650 N.  
Hammer having a free fall of 0.75m.  The sampler shall be driven using the hammer for 450mm recording 
the number of blows for every 150mm.  The number of blows for every 150mm shall be recorded.  The num-
ber of blows for the last 300mm drive shall be reported as N value.  This test shall be discontinued when the 
blow count is equal to 100 or the penetration is less than 25mm for 50 blows whichever is earlier.  At the 
location where the test is discontinued the penetration and the number of blows shall be reported . Sufficient 
quantity of disturbed soil samples shall be collected from the split spoon sampler for identification and la-
boratory testing.  The sample shall be visually classified and recorded at the site and shall be properly pre-
served without loss of moisture content and labelled for future identification.  
Retainer baskets, springs, or flap valves shall be used to ensure sample recovery.  
 
Samples obtained shall be placed in ½ litre glass jars or approved equal and sealed with vapor -seal lids. 
Each jar shall be clearly identified with the use of a waterproof marker, and shall show the job name, boring 
number, sample number, depth, length of recovery, and standard penetration resistance.  
 
5.3 Sampling  
5.3.1  General  
a. Sufficient number of soil samples shall be collected for reliable estimation of soil properties.  The 
samples collected shall be either disturbed or undisturbed.  Disturbed soil samples shall be collected 
for field identification and conducting tests such as sieve analysis, index properties, specific gravity, 
chemical analysis, etc.  Undisturbed samples shall be collected to estimate the physical, strength 
and settlement properties of the soil.  
b. All the accessories required for sampling and the method of sampling shall conform to IS: 2132. All 
the disturbed and undisturbed samples collected in the field shall be classified at the site as per IS: 
1498.  
c. All the samples shall be identified with date, bore hole number or trial pit number, depth of sampling 
etc.  It is also essential to mark an arrow pointing towards the top surface of the sample as the soil   
Terms of Reference for Geotechnical Investigation Survey  
 Page 10 
 
 was in -situ.  Care shall be taken to keep the core samples and box samples vertically with the arrow 
directing upwards.  The tube samples shall be properly trimmed at both the ends and suitably 
capped and sealed with molten paraffin wax.  
d. When the collection of undisturbed soil sample at a specified depth is not possible, the reason for the 
same shall be indicated in the bore  log.  In such a case, undisturbed sampling may be replaced by 
Standard Penetration test for cohesion less soil or by field Vane Shear test for very soft to soft cohe-
sive soil.  
e. Precaution shall be taken to ensure that there shall not be any change in moisture content and dis-
turbance of the soil samples,  and they shall be placed in a temporary store at the end of the day’s 
work.  The contractor shall be responsible for packing and transporting of all the samples from site to 
the laboratory within seven days after sampling with proper protection against loss and damage.  
5.3.2  Disturbed Sample  
a. Disturbed soil samples shall be collected in bore holes at regular intervals to provide a complete de-
scription of soil profile and its variation.  Jar samples weighing approximately 10 N shall be collected 
in boreholes at 1.5m intervals starting from a depth of 0.5m below ground level and at every identifi-
able change of strata to supplement the boring records.  Samples shall be immediately stored in air-
tight jars and shall fill the jar as far as possible.  
b. In elevated areas, if superficial material is available in plenty, then bulk samples from a depth of 
about 0.5m below ground level shall be collected to establish all the required properties to use it as a 
fill material.  Disturbed samples weighing about 25 Kg. shall be collected at shallow depths and im-
mediately stored in polythene bags as per IS:1892.  The bags shall be sealed properly to avoid any 
change in moisture content,  and they shall be kept in wooden boxes.  
5.3.3  Undisturbed Sample  
In each borehole undisturbed sample shall be collected at regular intervals of 3.0m and every change of 
strata and as directed by the Engineer.  Samples shall be  as per IS code .  Samples shall be collected in 
such a manner that the structure of the soil and its moisture content do not get altered.  Undisturbed sam-
pling in sand shall be done using compressed air technique mentioned in IS: 8763.  Thin-walled  sampler 
shall be used to collect undisturbed samples by pushing the tube into the soil.  The sampling tube shall have 
a smooth finish on both surfaces and minimum effective length as specified in IS code .  The area ratio of 
sampling tubes shall be less than 10%.  However, in case of stiff soils, area ratio up to 20% shall be permit-
ted.   
Terms of Reference for Geotechnical Investigation Survey  
 Page 11 
 
 5.3.4  Undisturbed sampling in cohesive soil   
Undisturbed samples in soft to stiff cohesive soils shall be obtained using a thin-walled  sampler.  In order to 
reduce the wall friction, suitable precautions such as oiling the surfaces shall be taken.  The bore hole shall 
be cleaned and the depth of sampling below the ground level shall be noted.  The sampler shall then be 
attached to the bottom of the boring rods and lowered into the borehole.  The sampler shall be pushed into 
the clay layer by hand or by jacking and soil sample of specified length shall be collected without disturbing 
the soil.  The distance by which the sampler penetrates  the soil strata shall be checked, care being taken to 
ensure that the sampler is not driven too far as this will compress the soil.  The sampler shall be rotated to 
break the core at the bottom of the sampler and then steadily drawn up.  
5.3.5  Undisturbed Sampling using Piston Sampler  
Undisturbed samples in very loose saturated sandy and silty soils and very soft clays shall be obtained by 
using a piston sampler consisting of a sampling cylinder and piston system.  In soft clays and silty clays, with 
water standing in the casing pipe, piston sampler shall be used to collect undisturbed samples.  During this 
method of sampling expert supervision is called for.  
The interior surface of the sampler shall be smooth, clean and corrosion resistant.  Its cutting edge and the 
ring seats shall be inspected for wear and rejected if worn.  Check shall be done to ensure that the moving 
parts of the sampler function freely before the sampler is lowered into the bore hole.  While pushing the sys-
tem into the soil and till the beginning of the sampling operations, the bottom of the piston shall be flush with 
the cutting edge of the sampler.  At the depth of sampling, the piston should be fixed relative to the ground 
and the sampler cylinder shall be independently pressed down smoothly and continuously into the ground.  If 
an obstruction is met, the sampler shall be withdrawn,  and another sample taken after the obstruction is re-
moved.  
Accurate measurements of the depth of sampling, height of sampler, stroke and length of sample recovery 
shall be recorded.  After the sampler is pushed to the required depth, both the sampler cylinder and piston 
system shall be drawing up together ensuring that there shall not be any disturbance to the sample which 
shall then be protected from changes in moisture content . 
5.3.6  Relaxation during Sampling  
a. The sampler should be pushed into the soil and driving of sampler should be resorted to only when it 
cannot be pushed into the soil.  This shall be done only with the permission of the Engineer and all 
the details about the same shall be recorded in the bore logs.  
b. In clays when N value is above 30, undisturbed samples may be replaced by standard penetration 
test.

 5.4 Ground Water  
a. One of the following methods shall be adopted for determining the ground water table in bore holes 
as per IS: 6935 and as per the instructions of the Engineer. In permeable soils, the water level in the 
borehole shall be allowed to stabilise after depressing it adequately by bailing.  When the water level 
inside the borehole is found to be stable, the depth of water level below ground level shall be meas-
ured.  Stability of sides and bottom of the bore hole shall be ensured at all times . 
b. For both permeable and impermeable soils, the following method shall be suitable.  The bore hole 
shall be filled with water and then bailed out to various depths.  Observations on the rise or fall of 
water level shall be made at each depth.  The level at which either a fall or a rise is observed, this 
shall be considered as the water table elevation.  This shall be established by three successive read-
ings of water level taken at an interval of two hours.  
In case any variation in ground water level is observed in any special boreholes, then the water level in these 
boreholes shall be recorded during the course of the field investigation.  Levels in nearby wells, streams, etc. 
if any shall also be noted whenever these readings are taken.  
It is important that some standpipes  and piezometers are installed, prior to the coming monsoon, in order to 
record the local effects and variations in the ground water level during that period.  
Standpipes  and Piezometers shall consist of 19mm internal diameter rigid unplasticized  (UPVC) tubing.  All 
the joints in the tubing shall be made of coupling sleeves.  The top of UPVC tubing shall be enclosed in a 
75mm diameter galvanised steel pipe of 1.5m length having a galvanised steel screw cap with well -greased 
threads and the cap shall be tightened such that it would be impossible to loosen by hand.  The lower end of 
the pipe shall have four legs 6mm thick and 100mm long end welded to have projection of 25mm.  The pipe 
shall be sealed into the ground with cement grout so that it does not rotate.  The top end of the pipe shall 
project approximately 300mm above ground level unless otherwise specified by the Engineer.  
The perforated tubing or the porous element shall be surrounded by a response zone of well graded sand 
from 500mm below to 150mm above the lower end of the standpipe  or Piezometer, and the borehole above 
the response zone shall be back filled with natural soil or well graded sand.  The later shall compose of parti-
cles that vary in amount according to the size in such a manner that the void space formed by the larger 
particles can be filled by smaller size particles.  
5.4.1  Subsoil Water Samples  
a. Sub-soil water samples shall be collected for carrying out chemical analysis thereon.  Representative 
samples of ground water shall be collected when it is first encountered in bore holes before the addi-
tion of water to aid boring or drilling.  Water samples shall not be collected when bentonite slurry or 
mud has been used for drilling operation.  If water has been added for drilling purposes or if ground   
Terms of Reference for Geotechnical Investigation Survey  
 Page 13 
 
 water has been diluted by surface rainwater , then the bore hole shall be dewatered,  and water al-
lowed to rise from which the sample may be taken.  
b. The sampling apparatus shall be such that the water at the desired depth can be collected directly 
without any disturbance and any change in the concentration of the constituents like dissolved gas-
es, etc.  Undue agitation shall be avoided.  An ordinary suction pump with the suction end inserted 
up to the required depth in the borehole shall be used for this purpose.  
c. The sample shall be collected in a clean vessel and allowed to settle so that the supernatant liquid 
can be poured into a clean well -rinsed glass or polythene bottle.  Sufficient quantity and number of 
samples shall be collected to carry out the chemical analysis and sent to a laboratory in airtight bot-
tles with proper labelling, chemical analysis of water samples shall include determination of pH val-
ue, turbidity; sulphate, carbonate, nitrate and chloride contents; presence of organic matter and sus-
pended solids.  
d. In some cases, constituents may be mixed and analysed later as specified in the specific test meth-
ods.  Chemical preservatives may be added to the sample for cases as specified in the test method 
or IS codes.  This shall only be done if analysis cannot be conducted within an hour of collection and 
shall have the prior written permission and approval of the Engineer.  
5.5 Trial Pit  
Trial pit shall be of minimum 3m x 3m size at the bottom so as to permit easy access for visual examination 
of walls of the pit and to facilitation sampling and in -situ testing operations.  Pits shall be up to 2m deep or as 
per the directions of the Engineer.  Precautions shall be taken to ensure the stability of pit walls including 
provision of shoring, if necessary, as per IS:4453.  Precautions shall be taken to prevent surface water drain-
ing into the pit.  Arrangements shall be made for dewatering if the pit is extended below water table.  Trial 
pits shall be kept dry, and a ladder shall be provided for easy access to the bottom of the pit.  In -situ tests 
shall be conducted,  and undisturbed samples shall be collected immediately on reaching the specified depth 
so as to avoid substantial changes in moisture content of the subsoil.  Arrangements shall be made for barri-
ers, protective measures and lighting necessary for the period the pits remain open.  
A note on the visual examination of soil strata shall be prepared.  This should include the nature, colour, 
consistency and visual classification of the soil, thickness of soil strata, ground water table, if any, etc.  
Undisturbed samples shall be collected at 1.0m depth and at the termination depth in all pits.  
5.5.1  Chunk Samples  
In cohesive soils, undisturbed samples of regular shapes shall be collected.  The samples shall be cut and 
trimmed to a suitable size (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3m).  A square area (0.35 x 0.35m) shall be marked at the centre of 
the levelled surface at the bottom of the pit.  Without disturbing the soil inside the marked area, the soil   
Terms of Reference for Geotechnical Investigation Survey  
 Page 14 
 
 around this marking shall be carefully removed up to  a depth of 0.35m.  The four vertical faces of the soil 
block protruding at the centre to be trimmed slowly so that its size reduces to 0.3x0.3m.  Wax paper cut to 
suitable size shall be wrapped uniformly covered with two layers of thin cloth over all the 5 exposed surfaces 
of the soil block and sealed properly using molten wax.  A firmly constructed wooden box of size 0.35 x 0.35 
(internal dimensions) with the top and bottom open shall be placed around the soil block and held such that 
its top edge protrudes just above the surface of the block.  The space between the soil block and the box 
shall be filled uniformly and tightly with most sawdust.  The top surface shall also be covered with sawdust 
before nailing the wooden lid to cover the box firmly taking care that the soil block is not disturbed.  The area 
of contact between the bottom portion of the block and the ground shall be reduced slowly by removing soil 
in small quantities using small rods, so that the block can be separated from the ground slowly without dis-
turbance.  After inverting the wooden box along with the soil block, the bottom portion shall be trimmed and 
covered with wax paper, cloth and sealed with molten wax.  A wooden lid shall be nailed to the box after 
providing proper saw dust cushion below it.  An arrow mark shall be made on the vertical face of the wooden 
box to indicate the made on the vertical face of the wooden box to indicate the top surface along with the 
coordinates and depth of sampling.  
 
5.5.2  Tube Samples  
Undisturbed tube samples may also be obtained by means of a 100mm diameter sampling tube with a cut-
ting edge.  The sampler shall be slightly oiled or greased inside and outside to reduce friction.  The sampler 
shall be pushed into the soil and while doing so, soil around the tube shall be carefully removed.  In case it is 
not possible to push the sample, it may be driven by light blows from a monkey.  
After the completion of the test, sampling and visual examination, the pit shall be suitably backfilled as di-
rected by the Engineer.  Unless otherwise specified, excavated soil shall be used for this purpose.  
In each trial pit the soil in -situ density shall be determined by the sand replacement method.  The specifica-
tions, equipment, accessories required for the test and test procedure shall be as per IS:2720, Part XXVIII.  
No separate payment shall be made for this test.
